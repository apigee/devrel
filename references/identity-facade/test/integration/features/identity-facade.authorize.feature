@authorize
Feature:
  As a Client App 
  I want to access the protected resource of an API
  So that I can retrieve different types of information

  Scenario: I should get an error if client_id is missing or invalid
    When I GET /authorize?client_id=xxx&redirect_uri=https://httpbin.org/get&response_type=code&state=12345&scope=openid%20email
    Then response code should be 401
    And response body should be valid json

  Scenario: I should get an error if client_id contains heading or trailing spaces
    When I GET /authorize?client_id=`spaceCharacters``clientId`&redirect_uri=https://httpbin.org/get&response_type=code&state=12345&scope=openid%20email
    Then response code should be 401
    And response body should be valid json
    
  Scenario: I should get an error if redirect_uri is missing or invalid
    When I GET /authorize?client_id=`clientId`&redirect_uri=https://example.com/invalid&response_type=code&state=12345&scope=openid%20email
    Then response code should be 400
    And response body path $.error should be invalid_request

    Given I navigate to the authorize page with an invalid response type
    Then I am redirected to the Client App
    Then I receive an unsupported_response_type error
