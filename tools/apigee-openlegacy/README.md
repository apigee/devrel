# Apigee OpenLegacy

A set of tooling and reference material for Apigee and OpenLegacy integration.

## API Facade on Mainframe

A common pattern in a Digital Transformation is the Facade pattern. This allows
APIs to be consistently managed by an API Management platform, regardless of the
technology used in the backend. This might be a collection of microservices in
Cloud Run, SOAP services and even mainframe integrations.

By combining Apigee and OpenLegacy, we can apply API Management policies such as
OAuth 2.0 security, Developer Portal onboarding, Analytics and Traffic
Management to our mainframe!

## Prerequisites

- Create a free Apigee Account
- Create OpenLegacy API Key
- Download OpenLegacy CLI from [the hub](https://app.ol-hub.com/)
- Install Maven and Git

## Quickstart Usage

For the best compatibility, run from a Google Cloud Shell

```sh
export OPENLEGACY_APIKEY=
export OPENLEGACY_HOST=
export OPENLEGACY_USER=
export OPENLEGACY_PASS=
export APIGEE_USER=
export APIGEE_PASS=
export APIGEE_ORG=
export APIGEE_ENV=
export GCP_PROJECT=

git clone https://github.com/apigee/devrel
sh ./devrel/tools/apigee-openlegacy/pipeline.sh
```

## Result

- OpenLegacy Module and Project created
- OpenLegacy connector deployed to Cloud Run
- Apigee Proxy Configured with service account keys to connect to Cloud Run,
  Spike Arrest and API Key check
- API Product, Developer and App configured

## Extend

Consider adding or customising policies for:

- Northbound API Security
- Traffic Management
- Custom Analytics
- Mediation and Orchestration
- API Versioning
- Developer Portal
- Monetization

You may also consider configuring OpenLegacy as a TargetServer to be shared by
proxies developed by multiple teams in a large organization.
