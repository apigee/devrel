# JavaScript in Apigee

This reference project demonstrates the best practices of writing JavaScript
code within the Apigee context.

It contains code to implement a simple response mediation that adds an
extra response header to the response content before sending it off to the
client application.

It also contains unit tests to test the JavaScript code and mock
Apigee global functions using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
