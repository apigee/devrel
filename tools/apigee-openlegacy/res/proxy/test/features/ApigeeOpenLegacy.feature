Feature:
  As a developer
  I want to modernise my mainframe with APIs
  So that I can apply API management best practices

  Scenario: Successfully get the OpenAPI spec
    When I GET /openapi/openapi.yaml?apikey=`apikey`
    Then response code should be 200

  Scenario: Successfully use Apigee OpenLegacy Kickstart
    Given I set body to { "customerid": "0001" }
    And I set Content-Type header to application/json
    When I POST to /getcst?apikey=`apikey`
    Then response code should be 200
    And response body path $.status should be OK
    
  Scenario: Missing API Key
    Given I set body to { "customerid": "0001" }
    And I set Content-Type header to application/json
    When I POST to /getcst
    Then response code should be 401
