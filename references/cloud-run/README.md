# Apigee X and Cloud Run

Reference Implementation for how to front a Cloud Run service with Apigee X.

## Compatibility

This example is built using the [GCP Service Account Association](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/security/google-auth/overview)
that is available in Apigee X and hybrid. For scenarios where this option is not
available you could make use of the [GCP SA shared flow](../gcp-sa-auth-shared-flow)
to obtain a valid access token and use it within the ServiceCallout policy.
